# Welcome to the M-STARX GitHub + Python training file! If you've made it here
# you already completed a few steps, so good job! You can complete this training
# by accomplishing every task marked with "TODO". When you complete a step,
# remove the "TODO" comment! Once you've cleared every "TODO" statement, push
# your final file to your GitHub branch :)

# Note: this tutorial is very basic, especially if you're more experienced coder.
# We often have people joining the team from a wide variety of skill levels, so this is just
# intended to get everyone's personal machines set up and give people a basic familiarity with
# GitHub and Python syntax. I promise you'll learn tons of more involved stuff as the year 
# progresses on your subteam!!

# TODO: if your IDE throws and a "Module Not Found" error on line 1 and/or 2 when you run 
# this code, you need to use pip (or pip3) to install numpy. Importing libraries
# is a crucial part of Python, and pip is a great way to quickly install them to
# your computer. 
# You can run "pip install numpy" to download the numpy library.

# TODO: Use the "git checkout -b" command to create a new branch in the repository
# and switch to it. Name your branch your uniqname, and run "git status" to make sure
# you successfully switched to it. If it says "on branch {uniqname}", you did it right!

# To practice with Python, you'll write a couple functions to manipulate a numpy array,
# as well as a main script to run those functions on a sample array

# TODO: Complete the function fillArray()
# This function fills a numpy array with values from data_list in order.
# If size is specified, the array is declared with shape (1, size). If size is 
# unspecified, the array is declared with the same number of rows and columns, which is math.sqrt(len(data_list))
def fillArray(data_list, size=None):
    arr = None
    if size == None:
        # TODO: initialize "arr" with equal number of rows and columns (hint: use np.empty())
        # check your work:
        if (arr.shape == (math.sqrt(len(data_list)), math.sqrt(len(data_list)))): print("Array Initialized Correctly!")
    else:
        # TODO: initialize "arr" with 1 row and {size} columns
        if (arr.shape == (1, size)): print("Array Initialized Correctly!") # check your work: prints the shape of the array
    # TODO: Use a for loop to fill arr with each item in data list, in order
    
    # returns the array
    return arr

# TODO: Complete the main script
# Lists are a common Python container, similar to vectors in C++ and MATLAB
list = [1, 2, 3, 4] # this is a really simple list, with 5 elements

# TODO: Call fillArray() on list (with or without a size argument -- up to you!), then store the return
# array in a variable

# TODO: Do some cool matrix math with the numpy array! There's a lot of operations built into numpy.
# I don't care how you manipulate the array, but do 3 operations on it (they can be super basic, like 
# .T or adding/subtracting a column)
    # 1. operation 1
    # 2. operation 2
    # 3. operation 3

# TODO: 3-D arrays are also common in Python. Append a third dimension to your matrix (hint: use np.expand_dims())

# TODO: replace None with your matrix variable to print the final array
print(f"Final Array: {None}")

# TODO: Push your final changes to your GitHub branch in 3 steps:
#   1. Stage your changes for commit using the "git add" command. You can type the filename,
#      or just use "git add --all" to stage all the files you've changed in the repository.
#   2. Commit your changes to the reppository with "git commit -m "{commit message}"". Your
#      commit message should be short but descriptive!
#   3. Push your changes using the command "git push".
#   4. Check that you changes pushed successfully by running "git status".
